## Technologies Used: 
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- React
- Axios 

## Getting Started:
- Orignal plan of revamping my Music App had to be scrapped due to time constraints so I had to swap to doing a basic to do list app.
- App includes Create, Read, and Delete functionality integrated from the back end. GitHub link to [back end](github.com/C3-PIO/ToDoListBE).

## Unsolved Problems:
- Independent checkbox functionality
- Incoporate PUT method route from the back-end to edit/update list items 
- Using bootstrap for a more appealing look. 

## Future Enhancements:
- Add state for the checkboxes so item can be checked/unchecked independently
- Include a hidden form that will pop up over the list item when the user would like to edit that task
- Enhance styling with bootstrap for a better look and increased responsiveness
